Ans:3 features of my project:
    • Course selection with cart management and credit limit control.
    • Dynamic price calculation and responsive design for various screens.
    • Prevents duplicate course selection with toast notifications.


Q2. Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
Ans: In my assignment project, I managed the state using React's useState and useEffect hooks. I employed useEffect to fetch mock data from a JSON file during component initialization, and then used useState to set and handle this data. Additionally, I used useState to manage the state of selected courses, allowing users to interact with and review their selections. This combination of hooks allowed for efficient state management within the project.
